            <span className="aboutDescription">
                As an aspiring web developer with a unique background in HR, I bring a dynamic perspective to the world of technology. I have knowledge in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and in the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS), I am ready to embark on an exciting coding journey. <br />
                <br />
                Beyond my technical prowess, my soft skills in communication, adaptability, and rapid learning set me apart. I am eager to contribute and grow within an existing, collaborative team while thriving in an informal yet structured environment. I am actively seeking a role that not only allows me to expand my knowledge but also to make meaningful contributions to innovative projects. <br />
                <br />
                I love meeting new people and learning about new cultures! I have 6+ years of international living abroad experience - Brazil, USA and The Netherlands
